GOOGLE AI CHALLENGE "PLANET WARS" SUBMISSION
============================================

Overview
--------

This is the source code of my 2nd place submission for Google AI Challenge which was run 
in the Fall of 2010.  It consists mostly of the starter pack, the submission code and a
script that compiles the submission zip file.  Other tools that I made to prepare this
challenge submission -- PlanetWarrior testing environment and the map extractor 
bookmarklet -- are located in other repositories linked below. 

Before using this, be aware that this competition occurred in 2010.  The code, tools, 
links, and other materials may be dead, out of date, or no longer relevant.  I have not 
maintained this repository since the contest submission, and will not maintain it.
